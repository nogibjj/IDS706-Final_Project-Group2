# IDS706-Final_Project-Group2
## Introduction & Motivation
Fraud is a pervasive issue that impacts numerous industries, and implementing effective fraud detection mechanisms is crucial for safeguarding businesses and consumers from financial loss. As data scientists, we are passionate about leveraging advanced analytical techniques, including machine learning, to identify and combat fraudulent activities. We are particularly interested in utilizing supervised learning models, such as decision trees and support vector machines, to develop predictive models that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions. Additionally, we are intrigued by the potential of unsupervised learning methods, such as clustering algorithms, to identify anomalies and potential fraud in complex datasets. A data science/engineering project focused on fraud detection has the potential to make significant contributions to the field and to aid in the protection of businesses and consumers from fraudulent behavior.
