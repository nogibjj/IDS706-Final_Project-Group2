# IDS706-Final_Project-Group2
## Introduction & Motivation
Fraud is a pervasive issue that impacts numerous industries, and implementing effective fraud detection mechanisms is crucial for safeguarding businesses and consumers from financial loss. As data scientists, we are passionate about leveraging advanced analytical techniques, including machine learning, to identify and combat fraudulent activities. We are particularly interested in utilizing supervised learning models, such as decision trees and support vector machines, to develop predictive models that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions. Additionally, we are intrigued by the potential of unsupervised learning methods, such as clustering algorithms, to identify anomalies and potential fraud in complex datasets. A data science/engineering project focused on fraud detection has the potential to make significant contributions to the field and to aid in the protection of businesses and consumers from fraudulent behavior.

## Steps
In order to carry out our data science project, we took the following steps:

1. We located a relevant dataset on Kaggle, a popular platform for data science resources. (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dermisfit/fraud-transactions-dataset)
2. We divided the work among our team members, with each member responsible for a specific aspect of the project. This included data cleaning and exploration, as well as the use of visualization tools to gain insights.
3. We employed machine learning models to model the data, with the goal of making predictions and identifying patterns.
4. We utilized Swagger Documentation to query the data using various methods, including Pandas, SQL, and Dask/Spark. This allowed us to return useful information to users.
5. We finalized our report and prepared a presentation to showcase our findings and methodology.

## Results
Here is the table of the model results:
